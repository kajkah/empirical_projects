1. Run the Stata Do-fil "00_merge.do" in order to merge the raw micro datasets downloaded from:
https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/
-> change the path in the beginning to the main folder in which the subfolders code, output and data are stored.

OR you can start directly in Matlab since the merged dataset "data_merged.csv" is saved in "data".

2. Run the Matlab script "a_meta.m" which will run all our code and save the results to the "output" folder. 
-> change the path in the beginning to the main folder in which the subfolders code, output and data are stored.
It is crucial to first set the paths in the meta script before running the scripts individually.
